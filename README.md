Consignment Retail POS System.
Tech used:
Bootstrap
Angular
Node
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose

I used to work at a consignment retail shop in NE Minneapolis, and they never liked their POS system, so I decided to try and create one that met their specific needs.
This is still a work in progress.
It can create new vendors and attach items/products to those specific vendors. On the POS side, you can enter ID #s to create a bill and check out. It's not hooked up to any payment system, like Square, yet.

TODO:
Create edit and remove functionality to vendors and items.
Send receipt information to the database to keep track of sales.
Connect with a payment system.
